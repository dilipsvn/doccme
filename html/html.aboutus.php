		<b>Dear CME Administrators,</b>
		<p>I am Dr. Reshi, the CEO of DocCME, a Minnesota based company. I have been in this field for the past 10 years and have always felt a need for someone to book my CME, so I can focus on my career. </p>
		<p>My colleagues and I came up with this idea and we formed an association with IRMAC, a world renowned IT company. Together we have developed a sophisticated database that allows us to search  CMEs based on multiple factors.  Our system enables us to find the appropriate CME, a suitable venue and date for doctors.</p>
		<b>Here is how our operation works:</b>
		<ol>
			<li>A doctor calls an (1-800-XXX-XXXX) or visits our website (www.doccme.com).</li>
			<li>A doctor can look for the CME and book it on the web.</li>
			<li>Our Customer Service Agents (CSA) will guide clients (the doctor) to pick the desired CME and book it for them.</li>
			<li>We do this all gratis to the client.</li>
		</ol>
		<b>Advantages:</b>
		<ol>
			<li>Improve profits by reducing overheads.</li>
			<li> Reduce incoming calls to your office.</li>
			<li>Improve profits by reducing your advertisement costs.</li>
		</ol>
		<b>How to update our database</b>
		<ul>
			<li>You can  register and update our data base over web.</li>
			<li>Give us a call with CME details and our customer service agent will update.</li>
			<li>Mail us the details of the CME program.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><br/>
		  <b>Sincerely</b>
		  <br/>
